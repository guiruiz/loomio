# Insert the plugins you'd like to add to your instance here.
# The format is as follows:
# plugins:
#   plugin_name:
#     repo: loomio/my_awesome_plugin (required, note that we only support github repositories at the moment)
#     version: branch, tag, or commit you'd like to clone. (optional, accepts anything which can be passed to 'git checkout`, defaults to 'master')

# In order to clone, you'll need to supply some github credentials in your ENV, like so:
# GITHUB_USERNAME: loomio
# GITHUB_PASSWORD: secret

# otherwise you'll have to put in your credentials for each plugin you clone and that will make you sad!

plugins:
  loomio_webhooks:
    repo:    loomio/loomio_webhooks
    version: master
